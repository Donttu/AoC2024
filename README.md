# AoC2024
Welcome to my Advent of Code 2024 code repository.

This year, I plan to upload my solutions here. 
While there is no specific reason for this, I believe it is beneficial to have them saved in this repository.

My goal is to write code in a language that is accessible and easy to understand for everyone. 
I acknowledge that my solutions may not be the most optimized or utilize the most complex methods. 
My focus is on maintaining readability for novice programmers and thoroughly documenting the essential steps of each program.
